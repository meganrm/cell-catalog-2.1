      caption: Single image of a live hiPSC colony expressing Desmoplakin-mEGFP imaged on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Left panel is a maximum intensity projection of the z-stack; right panel is this same projection overlaid onto one slice of the same z-stack in the transmitted light channel.

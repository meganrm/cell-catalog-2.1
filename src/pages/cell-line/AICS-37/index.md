      caption: Single mid-level plane of live hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes expressing mEGFP-tagged troponin I, slow skeletal. Twelve days after the onset of differentiation, cells were plated on PEI and laminin coated glass and imaged 15 days later on a spinning-disk confocal microscope (27 days total after the onset of differentiation). Scale bar, 10µm.

      caption: Viability and colony formation photographed 3 days post-thaw at 4X magnification. Cells were treated with ROCK inhibitor for 24 hrs post-thaw.

      caption: Z-stack of live hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes expressing mEGFP-tagged troponin I, slow skeletal. Twelve days after the onset of differentiation, cells were plated on PEI and laminin coated glass and imaged in 3D 19 days later on a spinning-disk confocal microscope (31 days total after the onset of differentiation). Cells were treated with 15 mM of the myosin inhibitor 2,3-Butanedione monoxime (BDM) to prevent beating during image acquisition. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Inset shows detail of sarcomeres in myofibrils. Scale bars, 5 µm and 10 µm for inset and larger field respectively.

      caption: Time-lapse movie of live hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes expressing mEGFP-tagged troponin I, slow skeletal. Twelve days after the onset of differentiation, cells were plated on PEI and laminin coated glass and imaged 15 days later on a spinning-disk confocal microscope (27 days total after the onset of differentiation). Cells were imaged continuously with a 100ms exposure time. Inset shows detail of sarcomeres in myofibrils. Scale bars, 5 µm and 10 µm for inset and larger field respectively. Movie plays in real time.

      caption: Single-planes of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged-beta-catenin. Z-planes shown are at the bottom (left), middle (middle) and top (right) of cells. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 5µm.

      caption: Viability and colony formation photographed 3 days post-thaw at 4X magnification. Cells were treated with ROCK inhibitor for 24 hrs post-thaw.

      caption: Z-stack of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged beta-catenin. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5µm.

      caption: Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged-beta-catenin. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 5 min. Image is a maximum intensity projection through the top 12 z-sections (3.19 µm) of the colony. Frames were histogram matched to adjust for photobleaching. Movie plays at 3000x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm.

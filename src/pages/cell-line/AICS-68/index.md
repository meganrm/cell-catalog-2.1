      caption: Single, mid-level plane of cells in a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged SMC protein 1A. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 5 µm.

      caption: Z-stack of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged SMC protein 1A. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5µm.

      caption: Time-lapse movie of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged SMC protein 1A. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 3 min. A single mid-level plane is shown. Frames were histogram matched to adjust for photobleaching. Movie plays at 900x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm.

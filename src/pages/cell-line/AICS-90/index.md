      caption: Single, mid-level plane of cells in a live hiPS cell colony expressing TagBFP-tagged dCas9-KRAB. TagBFP-tagged dCas9-KRAB (left) and overlay onto transmitted light image (right) are shown. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 50 μm.

      caption: Z-stack of live hiPS cell colony expressing TagBFP-tagged dCas9-KRAB. TagBFP-tagged dCas9-KRAB (left) and overlay onto transmitted light image stack (right) are shown. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 20 µm.

      caption: Single mid-level plane of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged nucleophosmin. Right panel is the same image as the left but with contrast enhanced to visualize dimmer localization in mitotic cells. Images are maximum intensity projections through the volume of the cells. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 5µm.

      caption: Viability and colony formation photographed 3 days post-thaw at 4X magnification. Cells were treated with ROCK inhibitor for 24 hrs post-thaw.

      caption: Z-stack of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged nucleophosmin. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Right panel is the same image as the left but with contrast enhanced to visualize dimmer localization in mitotic cells.  Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5µm.

      caption: Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged nucleophosmin. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 3 min. Image is a maximum intensity projection through the volume of the cells. Frames were histogram matched to adjust for photobleaching. Movie plays at 900x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm.

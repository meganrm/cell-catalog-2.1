      caption: Single, mid-level plane of cells in a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged Nucleoporin Nup153 protein. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Inset depicts the bottom z-section of the boxed cell to show localization of Nucleoporin Nup153 protein across the surface of the nuclear envelope. Scale bar, 5 µm.

      caption: Viability and colony formation photographed 3 days post-thaw at 4X magnification. Cells were treated with ROCK inhibitor for 24 hrs post-thaw.

      caption: Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged Nucleoporin Nup153 protein. Cells were imaged in a 3D volume spanning ~1.5 µm through the middle of the cells on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 3 min. A single mid-level z-section is shown. Movie plays at 1800x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm.

      caption: Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged Nucleoporin Nup153 protein. Cells were imaged in a 3D volume spanning ~1.5 µm through the middle of the cells on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 3 min. Image is a maximum intensity projection through the imaged volume. Movie plays at 1800x real time. Scale bar, 20 µm.

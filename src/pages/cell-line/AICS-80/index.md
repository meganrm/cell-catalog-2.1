      caption: Single, mid-level plane of cells in a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged RNA-binding protein FUS in control cells (left panel) and in the presence of 500 µM sodium arsenite for 15 min (right panel). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 5 µm.

      caption: Viability and colony formation photographed 3 days post-thaw at 4X magnification. Cells were treated with ROCK inhibitor for 24 hrs post-thaw.

      caption: Z-stack of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged RNA-binding protein FUS in control cells (left panel) and in the presence of 500 µM sodium arsenite for 15 min (right panel). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5µm.

      caption: Time-lapse movie of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged RNA-binding protein FUS. Six minutes after the introduction of 500 µM sodium arsenite, cells were imaged every 5 sec in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. A single mid-level plane is shown. The inset is a 2.5x enlargement of the boxed region to show detail of aggregate formation. Frames were histogram matched to adjust for photobleaching. Movie plays at 25x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm.
